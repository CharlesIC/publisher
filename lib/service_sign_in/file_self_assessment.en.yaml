    There are different ways to register if you’re:

    - [self-employed or a sole trader](/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return/register-if-youre-self-employed)
    - [not self-employed](/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return/register-if-youre-not-self-employed)
    - [registering a partner or partnership](/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return/register-if-youre-a-partner-or-partnership)

    Allow enough time to complete the registration process so you can send your return by the [deadline](/self-assessment-tax-returns/deadlines).

    ##If you’ve already registered

    Once you’ve registered, you need to ‘activate’ your Government Gateway account by linking it with your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR). You’ll get a letter that tells you how to do this.

    You can [create a Government Gateway account](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/government-gateway-registration-frontend/route?continue=%2Faccount&origin=unknown) if you don’t have one.

    ^ Don’t create a new account if you’ve activated one before. You can only link your UTR to one Government Gateway account. ^
